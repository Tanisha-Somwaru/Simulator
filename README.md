# Simulator
This simulator demonstrates how a computer processor works, in this case, objects called bits and words are used to represent the binary number that's sent to processor to perform certain
functions such as addition, subtraction, read and write for example. Bits are made up of booleans that represent the 0 and 1 of the binary, true or false. Words represent the 32-bit binary number instruction
that the bits form and are sent to the processor.
